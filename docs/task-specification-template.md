```

## Complexity Definitions

### **Simple**
- Straightforward implementation with clear path
- Minimal research or decision-making required
- Standard patterns and well-known solutions
- Low risk of unexpected complications

### **Medium** 
- Requires some research or analysis
- Multiple implementation approaches to consider
- May involve integration between systems
- Moderate risk of complications or edge cases

### **Complex**
- Significant research and analysis required
- Novel or innovative solutions needed
- High degree of uncertainty or ambiguity
- Multiple stakeholders or systems involved
- High risk of complications or scope creep

## Quality Level Definitions

### **Standard**
- Functional implementation meeting basic requirements
- Standard testing and documentation
- Good enough for internal use or MVP

### **High**
- Robust implementation with error handling
- Comprehensive testing and documentation
- Production-ready quality

### **Critical**
- Exceptional implementation with full edge case handling
- Extensive testing, monitoring, and documentation
- Mission-critical reliability and performance

## Benefits of This Approach

✅ **No Time Bias**: Agents work at optimal pace without artificial constraints
✅ **Quality Focus**: Clear expectations for thoroughness and robustness  
✅ **Complexity Awareness**: Agents understand the challenge level upfront
✅ **Resource Clarity**: All necessary tools and information specified
✅ **Success Metrics**: Clear definition of "done" without time pressure
