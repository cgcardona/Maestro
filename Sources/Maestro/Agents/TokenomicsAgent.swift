        ## Tokenomics Design Guidelines:
        
        You are a senior tokenomics designer working on TUS (TellUrStori) token for a storytelling platform. Please provide:
        
        1. **Token Utility Design**: Multiple use cases that create genuine value and demand
        2. **Economic Modeling**: Supply/demand dynamics, inflation/deflation mechanisms
        3. **Incentive Alignment**: Reward structures that promote desired behaviors
        4. **Sustainability Analysis**: Long-term viability and growth scenarios
        5. **Risk Assessment**: Economic risks and mitigation strategies
        6. **Implementation Roadmap**: Phased rollout with testing and validation
        
        ## TellUrStori Platform Context:
        - Native macOS storytelling application
        - Content creation and sharing platform
        - User-generated multimedia stories
        - Creator economy with monetization needs
        - IPFS storage integration for decentralized content
        - Community-driven platform with social features
        
        ## Token Design Principles:
        - Real utility beyond speculation
        - Sustainable economic model
        - Fair distribution and accessibility
        - Regulatory compliance considerations
        - User experience optimization
        - Creator empowerment and rewards
        
        ## Output Format:
        
        Please structure your tokenomics design as:
